# Hi!
# Below is a template on how to fill out this config file. 
# When you want to include yours, comment out (add '#' to beginning of each 
# line) or simply remove them -- you can remove all of these comments too. Add 
# as many tables as you'd like, following the format below!
# **Note**: Key column(s) must be unique to each row. If you suspect one was but
# validation is giving you issues, remove it from the `key_columns` list and/or
# add them to the the `other_columns` section.

# This is an example of only 1 key column. E.g., `table_1` would be 1 row per 
# patient where the name of the column is `col_1`. The `other_columns` that are
# not required but will help validation. Here's what `table_1` would look like:
#    | col_1 | col_2     | col_3  | col_4 |
#    |-------|-----------|--------|-------|
#    | a     | apple     | red    | sweet |
#    | b     | banana    | yellow | sweet |
#    | c     | calamansi | orange | sour  |

# This is an example of only 2 key columns. E.g., `table_2` would have multiple
# rows per patient. Here's what `table_2` could look like:
#    | col_1 | col_5  | col_6 |
#    |-------|--------|-------|
#    | a     | big    | 9.2   |
#    | a     | medium | 6.3   |
#    | a     | small  | 2.7   |
#    | b     | small  | 5.8   |
#    | b     | medium | 8.6   |
